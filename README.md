# MPhys Project

This is a repository for my masters project at the University of Oxford, "Predicting regional precipitation response to regional sea surface temperature anomalies". 

In a nutshell, the project was about applying Green's function approaches and convolutional neural networks to two related problems:
(i) emulating the precipitation predictions of a global climate model given sea surface temperature anomalies, and 
(ii) making hindcasts of precipitation in different regions using historical sea surface temperature data.

The repository rather messy as it contains most of the code I used to carry out the project. I am grateful towards my supervisors, Andrew Williams and Dr. Duncan Watson-Parris, for their time and help. 

Feel free to read my project report, ```JW_MPhys_report_Jun_12.pdf```, to learn more about the project.
