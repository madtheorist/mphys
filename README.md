# MPhys Project

This is a (rather messy) repository for my masters project at the University of Oxford, "Predicting regional precipitation response to regional sea surface temperature anomalies". I was supervised by Andrew Williams and Dr. Duncan Watson-Parris. 

Due to file size and data access restrictions, much of the raw data is not included.

For more information about the project, feel free to read my project report!
